For this assignment, you should have **one repository** for your team -- make sure to add all team members as **collaborators** to the project (see instructions on Canvas). 

To perform your analysis, you can use the (formatted) data file `data/wdvp.csv`, which is actually just the _what makes a 'good' government_ tab from the excel file `data/WDVP-Datasets.xlsx` (originally downloaded from [here](https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/)).
